Lecturers Comments:

Areas to improve:

- Use the URL tag in your templates.

- Remove temporary or test files from your project to reduce clutter and confusion later on.

- Keep your formatting and indentation uniform across the whole project.

- Don't attach data to the context unless you intend to use it in the template.

- Consider including the image location of the vehicle as an attribute of your data class.

- When creating a HTML list, the tags that establish the list should not be included in the for-loop, just the list item tags & the data.  Otherwise you are creating lots of separate lists, not one list with multiple pieces of data.

- Data Model...
-- The field's name must match exactly, including both spelling and case.
-- Try to keep the order of the fields the same as within your application's code.
